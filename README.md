<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started
This is JavaScript Web application which runs in the browser. You need a V8 engine to run JavaScript program. For the purpose of this project I used Google Chrome browser.

### Prerequisites
You need to have Node, yarn and npm installed on your machine. To check if they are installed, open up a terminal window and type the following:
 ```sh
npm -v
yarn -v
node -v
   ```
   
If these commands print out a version number in the terminal, you are good to go. If not, you need to go ahead and install what is missing. For the purpose of this project, I used [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
